              Before we started to work on the redesign project, the UX team showed us an extensive Figma prototype of
              proposed changes to the <em>Sale</em> and <em>Lot</em> page. They were excited about rolling about these
              updates before a certain sale was to go live, which was about 6 months. They decided they wanted to roll
              out various updates all at once, ideally 4-6 weeks before sale day.

              After the prototype demo, the task at hand was to roll out the two most important pages on our website
              during sale season. The prototype had various &ldquo;skin-job&rdquo; implementation of existing
              components, coupled with minor data updates.

                  Upon hearing these discussions, I promoted an interative dev and deployment approach for the two
                  pages. This will allow us to focus on the individual components and test its implementation for not
                  just the two updated pages, but also other pages, like homepage. I also proposed component milestones
                  and page layout milestones to divide the work within the team.

              The Experience team initially were open to iterative deployment. However, after another discussion that I
              was not part of, the final decision was to revert to waterfall approach. The UX team felt that since the
              redesign wasn&apos;t a feature that had a hard deadline, the UX team felt more comfortable rolling out
              these updates all at once to mimic a Grand &quot;ReOpening&quot;. <strong>Result</strong>: It&apos;s still
              not up.

              <strong>Situation</strong>:&nbsp;Prior to my MBA, I worked as a consultant at Deloitte. During that time,
              I experienced conflict with one of my co-consultants when we were staffed on a rapid turnaround study for
              a struggling retail player. Specifically, we disagreed with the course of action the retailer should take.
              While I thought the retailer should have prioritized action items that would boost its profitability in
              the next 1-2 quarters, the other consultant thought the retailer should focus on actions that would set it
              up for long-term success.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tasks</strong>:&nbsp;At the end of the day, I knew that the other consultant and I both wanted
              what&rsquo;s best for the client. In addition, I recognized that given the client was in such a dire
              situation, they may react negatively to longer-term strategy recommendations given without strong actions
              in the next 2 quarters, the client may not need the longer-term strategy work (e.g., if they were sold to
              a strategic buyer). However, I also saw where my co-worker was coming from, and realized that my
              recommendation may not have explicitly addressed that any actions done should hopefully bring the client
              closer towards achieving their long-term vision.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Action</strong>: After reflecting on the situation, I went to talk with my co-worker around the
              areas of focus for the client. As such, when talking with the co-worker, I first admitted what I may have
              overlooked. Then, I discussed why I felt it was more important to focus on the near-term actions, bringing
              in specific quotes the client previously said as support. Throughout the discussion, I continued to use
              how our work could enable the client&rsquo;s success as the “guidepost,” as I knew the co-worker and I had
              similar objectives.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Results</strong>: We focused our work on near-term objectives the client should take and called
              out that the near-term objectives should ensure the near-term work set them up for its long-term
              ambitions. The client was very happy, and once it got its bearing, re-engaged Deloitte for longer-term
              strategy work.
